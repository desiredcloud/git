## Merge without Switching branch

To merge the latest changes from the `main` branch on the remote repository into your current branch (`b1`) without switching to the `main` branch, you can use the `git fetch` and `git merge` commands. Here's how you can do it step by step:

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**:
   This updates your local repository with the latest changes from the remote branches without modifying your working directory.

   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Merge the latest changes from the `main` branch into your current branch (`b1`)**:
   This merges the fetched changes from the remote `main` branch into your current branch.

   ```sh
   git merge origin/main
   ```

By following these steps, you update your current branch (`b1`) with the latest changes from the `main` branch on the remote repository without having to switch branches. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Example

Assume you are currently on branch `b1` and want to incorporate the latest changes from `main`.

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote**:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```
   This command downloads the latest commits from the remote repository, updating your local remote-tracking branches (`origin/main` in this case) without changing your working directory or current branch.

2. **Merge the fetched changes from `origin/main`**:
   ```sh
   git merge origin/main
   ```
   This command merges the changes from the `origin/main` branch into your current branch (`b1`).

### Handling Conflicts

If there are conflicts between the changes in your branch (`b1`) and the `origin/main` branch, Git will prompt you to resolve them. You can use your preferred merge tool or manually edit the conflicting files to resolve the conflicts. After resolving the conflicts, you will need to stage the resolved files and complete the merge with the following commands:

1. **Stage the resolved files**:
   ```sh
   git add <file>
   ```

2. **Complete the merge**:
   ```sh
   git commit
   ```

### Summary

- **`git fetch origin`**: Updates your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository.
- **`git merge origin/main`**: Merges the latest changes from the `main` branch on the remote repository into your current branch (`b1`).

Using this approach allows you to stay on your current branch while incorporating the latest changes from the remote `main` branch, making it a convenient way to keep your branch up to date with the mainline development.
