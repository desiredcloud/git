- When you create or copy a new file in the working directory, the first state of the file is untracked. 
- This means that Git sees that there is something new, but it won't take care of it (it would not track the new file). 
- If you want to include the file in your repository, you have to add it using the add command. 
- Once it is added, the state of the file becomes unmodified. 
- It means that the file is new (Git says it is unmodified because it never tracked changes earlier) and ready to be committed, or it has reached the staging area (also called index). 
- If you modify a file that is already added to the index, it changes its status to modified


## Unstaging a file

-> HEAD points to the current branch name

```shell
/desiredcloud/learngit$ touch 3.txt
desiredcloud/learngit$ gs
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        3.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
desiredcloud/learngit$ ga .
desiredcloud/learngit$ gs
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   3.txt

desiredcloud/learngit$ git reset HEAD 3.txt
desiredcloud/learngit$ gs
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        3.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

### git restore --stage <file>

```shell
git restore --stage 3.txt
```

### Another option - git rm --cached

```shell
desiredcloud/learngit$ gs
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   3.txt

desiredcloud/learngit$ git rm --cached 3.txt 
rm '3.txt'
desiredcloud/learngit$ gs
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        3.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

-> This option simply removes it from the index, but not from the filesystem. However, remember that git rm is to remove files from the index. So, if you use the git rm command on an already committed file, you actually mark it for deletion

- At the end, once you commit, the present becomes part of the past. 
- The working directory comes back to the initial state, where all is untouched and the index is emptied.

## History

- `git log`
- `git log --graph`
- `git log --pretty=online`
- `$git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit`

## Gitignore

- `git add -f` to add file even if its marked ignored in .gitignore

## Tag a commit

- `git tag -a TagName -m "message"`
